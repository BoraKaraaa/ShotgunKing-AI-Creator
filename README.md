# ShotgunKing-AI-Creator

As a part of a university project, I developed an AI player for Shotgun King: Final Checkmate that uses heuristic parameters to make the optimal move and win the game in the shortest amount of time possible. Additionally, I designed the project to allow users to customize the heuristic parameters used by the AI. By doing so, the user can experiment with different heuristic parameter values and observe how these impact the AI's performance.

To achieve this, I used the best-first search algorithm, which is a heuristic search algorithm that uses a heuristic evaluation function to evaluate nodes for expansion. Using this algorithm, the AI player is able to evaluate and select the most promising move based on the given heuristic parameters, leading to the shortest path to victory.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of AI and heuristic search algorithms in enhancing gaming experiences. By allowing users to customize the heuristic parameters, this project also showcases the potential of user-driven AI development.
